# PASS Support

PASS Support contains ancillary components that assist in the submission process and is composed of the Data Loaders, 
Notification Services, and Deposit Services. The Data Loaders handle data ingestion from external systems like PubMed 
Central, NIH, FIBI (JHU Grant Management System), transforming grant, journal, and manuscript submission data into a 
standardized format within PASS. Deposit Services is responsible for the managing, packaging, and transfer of these 
submissions to downstream repositories such as PubMed Central and institutional repositories. Notification Services 
provide alerts and updates to relevant stakeholders based on submission workflows and events.

You can find further documentation and details about the [Data Loaders](https://docs.eclipse-pass.org/developer-documentation/data-loaders),
[Deposit Services](https://docs.eclipse-pass.org/developer-documentation/deposit-service), and [Notification Services](https://docs.eclipse-pass.org/developer-documentation/notification-service)
on the [full documentation site](https://docs.eclipse-pass.org). A full list of all the Eclipse PASS projects can also 
be found in the PASS Main repository [README](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/main/blob/main/README.md).
